        <p>
          GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exercise walks you through creating your first repository using GitHub through the web interface. You'll learn how to make commits, create issues, and create branches and merge them. You will also begin writing things in Markdown - a simple "markup" language used for blogging, documentation, and even writing papers!
        </p>
        <p>
          The example screenshots shown below follow <a href=http://github.com/joeyklee>Joey</a> planning a party. You can either do the same as him, or add your own information.
        </p>

        <h3>The Brief</h3>

        <p>
          Add a file that you'd like to version control to a new repository on GitHub. Change it and <strong>commit</strong> your change. Try creating a new <strong>branch</strong>, make a few changes then submit a <strong>pull request</strong> to yourself and merge the changes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="step-by-step">My first repository: Step by step</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <!-- Step 0 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Sign in to GitHub online</h1>
                <p>
                    Log into your github account.
                </p>

            </li>
            <!-- Step 1 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Create a Repo</h1>
                <p>
                    Every project starts by creating a "new repository"
                </p>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/new-repo.png">
            </li>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Create a title & description</h1>
                <p>Create a project title and description. Good practice is to either use dashes ("-") or underscores ("_") between words in your title (e.g. my-first-repo or my_first_repo)</p>

                <p>Write a short description of your repository.</p>

                <p>Initialize your repo with a README - the title and description you write above will be shown by default.</p>

                <p>(Note that it's a good idea to create a README even if you don't put any information in it. An empty git repository is not actually empty...but sometimes seems so to windows computers. Life is just quite a bit easiser if you start out with at least one file!)</p>

                <p>If you want to assign a license to your repo then select one here, but you can also add one in later.</p>

                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/new-repo-details.png">

                <center><p>Congratulations! You've made your first repo!</p></center>

            </li>
            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Your first commit</h1>
                <p>Let's start by adding some content to your README. To make your first commit, you are going to follow a few steps:
                </p>
                <p><strong>First: Click on the README.md & then edit button</strong></p>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/initial-repo-click.png">
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/edit-button.png">
                <p><strong>Second: Using the Markdown syntax put in the following sections and a short description for each</strong>
                </p>

# Friendly Collaboration Party

This repository is for planning a party to learn GitHub and more!

## About
This is some text about my project.
Parties are great right? Let me tell you how mine will be the very best.

## Team
So far my team is small - just 1 person, but I'm willing to work with you!
I'd really like for you to bring a few more people along to join in.

## Setup & Requirements
This project requires a computer and internet.
                </pre></code>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Third: Add a commit message</strong> - Your commit message should point to the changes that you've made (e.g. added content to readme) and press the commit button!
                </p>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/commit-message.png">

                <center><p> Hooray! 👏🏽✨🎉 Your first commit!</p></center>
            </li>
            <!-- Step 4 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Create an Issue</h1>
                <p>Go to the Issues Tab and create and issue about a task you want to complete (e.g. need more detailed README or create CODEOFCONDUCT.md).</p>

                <p>Assign the task to yourself where it says "Assignee" and "Assign yourself"</p>

                <p>Label the task in a category you think is appropriate - or create a new label!</p>

            <li>
                <h1>Create a branch</h1>
                <p>Create a branch to add some features to your project without affecting or possibly breaking the current state of your project.</p>

                <p>While in your new branch, "create a new file" or "edit" an existing file - try to address the issue you created above.</p>

            <li>
                <h1>Merge the changes from the branch</h1>
                <p>Once you've made some changes to an existing file or added a new file, try to merge that file back in to your "master" branch.</p>

                <p>Make sure your commit message on the merge is meaningful and points to the changes you made.</p>

            <li>
                <h1>Close the Issue</h1>
                <p>
                    If you believe you've done a good job addressing the issue you opened up earlier, close the issue!
                </p>
            </li>
