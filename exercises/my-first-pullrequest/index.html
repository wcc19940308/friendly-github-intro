        <p>
          GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This exercise walks you through adding your very first contribution to an open source collaborative project using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface.
        </p>

        <h3>The Brief</h3>

        <p>
          You're going to add a sentence to a file in your partner's repository. It doesn't matter what you say! You can add anything you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll have to <strong>fork the repo</strong>, <strong>make a change</strong> to the file, <strong>commit</strong> it to your fork, and then make a <strong>pull request</strong> to ask your partner to merge the edit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then <strong>switch roles</strong> and repeat! The contributor becomes the project owner and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have time, <strong>make an issue</strong> in your own repository suggesting a change that someone else could make and add a link as a comment to the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/issues/37>participant issue list</a> issue in the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/>friendly-github-intro</a> workshop repository. Then, either sit back and wait for someone to make that change for you, or go and see if you can help someone else move their project along.
        </p>

                    In the screenshots we're going to follow Kirstie making changes to the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro target="_blank">friendly-github-intro</a> repository. You'll want to go to your partner's repository link and edit one of the files there (probably the README.md file).

                <p>
                    You'll want to make whatever change you want to in your fork of your partner's repository.

                    If you see the error below, you're trying to <strong>edit the original version</strong> of the repository, not your own fork!

                    Go back to your home page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner, click on your profiles, and you should see <strong>your own fork</strong> of the repository there!

                  Now you're ready to ask the project owner to merge in your changes.

                <p>
                  If you've made a mistake, you might be asked to make further changes (but hopefully not!)

                <p>
                  If all goes well, <strong>CONGRATULATIONS!</strong> You've just made your first pull request and worked collaboratively on GitHub!

          <h2 id="stretch-goal">Stretch goal: Pull requests for other projects</h2>
          <p>
            Try asking other members of the workshop to help you. Create a new issue and add a link to the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/issues/37>participant issue list</a> issue in the <a href=https://github.com/KirstieJane/friendly-github-intro/>friendly-github-intro</a> workshop repository. Then, while you wait for another participant to help you fix the issue, take a look to see if there are any you can help with.
          </p>

          <p>
            Use the <strong>social features</strong> of GitHub as much as you can. If the issue isn't clear, <strong>ask</strong> for clarification. Be polite and as clear as possible whether you're the project owner or the contributor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember that to make a contribution to someone else's project you'll have to <strong>fork</strong> their repository so you have your own copy.
